# Rainfall Prediction Project

## Overview
This project focuses on predicting rainfall based on various meteorological features. The dataset used contains information such as altitude, precipitation levels for different months, geographical coordinates, and more.

## Project Structure
- Rainfall.csv: Contains the dataset used for training and testing.
- Rainfall_Prediction.ipynb: Jupyter Notebook containing the code for data preprocessing, exploration, model building, and evaluation.
- README.md: This file providing an overview of the project.

## Requirements
To run the code in Rainfall_Prediction.ipynb, the following Python libraries are required:
- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- scikit-learn
- imbalanced-learn

You can install these libraries using pip:


pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn imbalanced-learn


## Usage
1. Clone the repository:


git clone https://github.com/Madhumita1214/TNSDC-Generative-AI


2. Navigate to the project directory:


cd rainfall-prediction


3. Open and run the Jupyter Notebook Rainfall_Prediction.ipynb to execute the code step-by-step.

4. Follow the instructions and comments in the notebook for data preprocessing, visualization, model training, and evaluation.

## Results
The project aims to achieve accurate rainfall predictions using machine learning models. The evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score will be used to assess the performance of the models.
